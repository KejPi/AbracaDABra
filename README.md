## Basic mode
<img width="663" alt="Snímek obrazovky 2022-06-28 v 22 19 47" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6438380/176277787-7737ca9b-adb1-4d91-bf5b-bd9331d27663.png">

Simple user interface that is focused on radio listening. Just select your favorite service from service list on the right side 
and enjoy the music with slideshow and DL(+). 
Service can be easily added to favorites by clicking "star" icon.  Most of the elements in UI have tool tip with more information.

## Expert mode

In addition to basic mode, expert mode shows ensemble tree with structure of services and additional details of currenly tuned service. 
Furthermore it is possible to change the DAB channel manually in this mode. 
This is particularly useful when antenna adjustment is done in order to receive ensemble that is not captured during automatic band scan.
Expert mode can be enabled in Settings dialog.

## DAB Announcements support

An announcement is a period of elevated interest within an audio programme. It is typically a spoken audio message, often with a lead-in and lead-out 
audio pattern (for example, a musical jingle). It may refer to various types of information such as traffic, news, sports and others. [<a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103176/02.04.01_60/ts_103176v020401p.pdf">TS 103 176</a>]

All DAB(+) announcement types are supported by AbracaDABra, including test alarm feature (ClusterID 0xFE according to <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103176/02.04.01_60/ts_103176v020401p.pdf">TS 103 176</a>). 
The application is monitoring an announcement switching information and when the announcement is active, AbracaDABra switches audio output to a target 
subchannel (service). This behavior can be disabled by unchecking a particular announcement type in a Setup dialog. 
If an announcement occurs on the currently tuned service, it is only indicated by an icon after the service name. This icon can be clicked on, which 
suspends/resumes the ongoing announcement coming from another service. OE Announcements are not supported. 

The option "Bring window to foreground" tries to focus the application window when the alarm announcement starts. 
The alarm announcements carry emergency warning information that is of utmost importance to all radio listeners and they have the highest priority 
(according to <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103176/02.04.01_60/ts_103176v020401p.pdf">TS 103 176</a>) in the sense that alarm announcement cannot be disabled and it can interrupt any ongoing regular announcement.

Announcements from other service display a thematic placeholder. <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/basic-miscellany/lineal-color" title="linear color">The artwork of placeholders are created by Smashicons - Flaticon</a>

## Expert settings
Some settings can only be changed by editting of the INI file. File location is OS dependent:
* MacOS & Linux: `$HOME/.config/AbracaDABra/AbracaDABra.ini`
* Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\AbracaDABra\AbracaDABra.ini`

Following settings can be changed by editing AbracaDABra.ini:

      [General]
      audioFramework=0     # 0 means PortAudio (default), 1 means Qt audio framework
      
Application shall not run while changing INI file, otherwise the settings will be overwritten.

It is also possible to use other than default INI file using `--ini` or `-i` command line parameter.

## How to install

### MacOS

Download latest DMG file from [release page](https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/releases/latest) and install it like any other application. 

There are two versions of DMG, one for Intel Mac and the other from Apple Silicon Mac. Although Intel Mac application runs on both platforms, it is highly recommended to install Apple Silicon version if you have Apple Silicon Mac. Intel build requires at least MacOS Mojave (10.14) and Apple Silicon build needs at least MacOS BigSur (11).

### Windows

Download latest Windows zip file from [release page](https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/releases/latest) and unpack it to any folder on your drive. 

RTL-SDR devices need WinUSB driver for correct functionality under Windows. To install it, use Zadig that can be downloaded from [zadig.akeo.ie](https://zadig.akeo.ie). Please follow installation steps described [here](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/getting-the-rtl-sdr-to-work-on-windows-10/). When the driver is installed, start `AbracaDABra.exe` and first band scan should start automatically when RTL-SDR device is recognized. 

Please note that other applications requiring Realtek driver will not work with WinUSB driver from Zadig. 

### Linux

The simplest way is to download latest AppImage file from [release page](https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/releases/latest), 
make it executable and run it. 

There are two versions of AppImage - one for Intel/AMD 64 bit CPU (x86_64) the other for ARM64 CPU (aarch64) so make soure you are donwloading the one matching your hardware.

ArchLinux users can install AbracaDABra from <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/abracadabra">AUR</a>.
