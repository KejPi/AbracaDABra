# AbracaDABra
Abraca DAB radio is DAB and DAB+ Software Defined Radio (SDR) application. It works with cheap RTL-SDR (RTL2832U) USB sticks but also with Airspy R2 and Airspy Mini devices and with many devices supported by <a href="https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR/wiki">SoapySDR</a>. 

Application is based on Qt6 cross-platform software development framework and can run on any platform supported by Qt6. 
Prebuilt binaries are released for Windows, macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon) and Linux x86-64 and AARCH64 (AppImage). 
ArchLinux users can install AbracaDABra from <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/abracadabra">AUR</a>.

## Basic mode
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="663" alt="Application in basic mode" src="https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/assets/6438380/a3d0a656-9a7c-47bd-a2e2-bc8d283d080b">
</p>

Simple user interface that is focused on radio listening. Just select your favorite service from service list on the right side 
and enjoy the music with slideshow and DL(+). 
Service can be easily added to favorites by clicking "star" icon.  Most of the elements in UI have tool tip with more information.

## Expert mode
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="889" alt="Application in expert mode" src="https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/assets/6438380/a1fae228-4148-477a-8c95-96fcc3080297">
    <img width="1152" alt="Ensemble details" src="https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/assets/6438380/d2d552c2-360c-4f44-b3c7-8baa214ba7f9">
</p>

In addition to basic mode, expert mode shows ensemble tree with structure of services and additional details of currently tuned service. 
Furthermore it is possible to change the DAB channel manually in this mode. 
This is particularly useful when antenna adjustment is done in order to receive ensemble that is not captured during automatic band scan.
Expert mode can be enabled in Settings dialog.

## DAB Announcements support
An announcement is a period of elevated interest within an audio programme. It is typically a spoken audio message, often with a lead-in and lead-out 
audio pattern (for example, a musical jingle). It may refer to various types of information such as traffic, news, sports and others. [<a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103176/02.04.01_60/ts_103176v020401p.pdf">TS 103 176</a>]

All DAB(+) announcement types are supported by AbracaDABra, including test alarm feature (ClusterID 0xFE according to <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103176/02.04.01_60/ts_103176v020401p.pdf">TS 103 176</a>). 
The application is monitoring an announcement switching information and when the announcement is active, AbracaDABra switches audio output to a target 
subchannel (service). This behavior can be disabled by unchecking a particular announcement type in a Setup dialog. 
If an announcement occurs on the currently tuned service, it is only indicated by an icon after the service name. This icon can be clicked on, which 
suspends/resumes the ongoing announcement coming from another service. OE Announcements are not supported. 

The option "Bring window to foreground" tries to focus the application window when the alarm announcement starts. 
The alarm announcements carry emergency warning information that is of utmost importance to all radio listeners and they have the highest priority 
(according to <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103176/02.04.01_60/ts_103176v020401p.pdf">TS 103 176</a>) in the sense that alarm announcement cannot be disabled and it can interrupt any ongoing regular announcement.

Announcements from other service display a thematic placeholder. <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/basic-miscellany/lineal-color" title="linear color">The artwork of placeholders are created by Smashicons - Flaticon</a>

## SPI application and RadioDNS
<a href="https://www.worlddab.org/dab/data-applications/service-and-programme-information">Service and programme information</a> (SPI) application is supported. 
When SPI application is enabled in the settings and SPI is available for selected service and/or in the ensemble, application starts its decoding automatically.
SPI from X-PAD, from secondary service and from dedicated data service is supported, it can be even decoded from more sources in parallel. 
In general, SPI application is very slow and it takes several minutes to acquire all objects. AbracaDABra can use internet connection to download service logos and to retrieve service information using RadioDNS if it is supported by broadcaster of the selected service. 
Both internet connection and RadioDNS are optional features that are enabled by default.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="659" alt="uaSettings_20240209" src="https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/assets/6438380/8680dc2c-3cce-47f1-a87d-525121ab6270">
</p>

Service logos, XML files and internet download cache are stored in dedicated directory on the disk. Location of the cache is OS dependent:
* macOS: `$HOME/Library/Caches/AbracaDABra/`
* Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\AbracaDABra\cache\`
* Linux: `$HOME/.cache/AbracaDABra/`

AbracaDABra visualizes Electronic Program Guide (EPG) if it is provided by broadcaster in SPI application and/or over RadioDNS. In such case "Program guide..." menu item becomes active and user can browse through services program in interactive user interface.

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img width="1112" alt="EPG_20240209" src="https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/assets/6438380/fc2712e8-2b9d-483e-b089-169a77efa98f">
<p align="center" width="100%">

EPG dialog supports dragging or scrolling by mouse, specific program detail can be displayed by clicking on item. Audio service can be selected by clicking on the service name on the left side. 

## User application data storage
AbracaDABra can be configured to store all incoming data from slideshow (SLS) and/or SPI application. The configuration consists of storage folder that is common for both applications 
and subfolder template configurable for each application individually. Storage of data can be enabled for each application individually.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="659" alt="uaSettings_20240209" src="https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/assets/6438380/8680dc2c-3cce-47f1-a87d-525121ab6270">
</p>

Default storage folder is OS dependent:
* macOS: `$HOME/Downloads/AbracaDABra/`
* Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\AbracaDABra\`
* Linux: `$HOME/Downloads/AbracaDABra/`

Overwrite checkbox enables overwriting of the files with the same name. If it is not checked (default), new file with existing name will be ignored and not stored.

Subfolder template for each application can be created individually. Following tokens are supported:

| SLS   | SPI   | Token | Description | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---- | :-----------| :-------|
| * | * | `{serviceId}` | Current audio service ID (ECC+SID) as hexadecimal number | `e01234` |
| * | * | `{ensId}`     | Current ensemble ID (ECC+UEID) as hexadecimal number | `e0eeee` |
|   | * | `{scId}`      | Data service component ID as 12bit decimal number | `47` |
| * | * | `{transportId}` | MOT Object transport ID as 16bit decimal number, it shall uniquely identify "file" within single data MOT channel. [[EN 301 234 7.2.7.4](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301200_301299/301234/02.01.01_60/en_301234v020101p.pdf)]  | `123456` |
|   | * | `{directoryId}` | Directory ID is transport ID of MOT directory. | `654321` |
| * | * | `{contentName}` | MOT object content name parameter. It is used to uniquely identify an object. [[EN 301 234 6.2.2.1.1](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301200_301299/301234/02.01.01_60/en_301234v020101p.pdf)]  | `stationLogo` |
| * |   | `{contentNameWithExt}` | MOT object content name parameter with extension that is added based on MIME type if content name is without extension. | `stationLogo.jpeg` |

_Important notes:_
* Path template uses slash `/` as directories separator, backslash `\` is forbidden character.
* Path template can contain each token multiple times. All occurrences are then replaces by respective value. On the other hand, invalid token is left in the file path as it is.
* MOT object content name does not have to be a valid filename for any operating system, thus application replaces potentially "dangerous" characters by underscore `_`. For example this is perfectly valid content name: `http://www.example.com:80/logo1`. 
  Application transforms it to following string when subfolder path is created: `http___www.example.com_80_logo1`
* SLS is transferred in so called header mode [[EN 301 234 7.1](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301200_301299/301234/02.01.01_60/en_301234v020101p.pdf)]. In this mode only one MOT object (slide) is available.
* SPI application uses directory mode [[EN 301 234 7.2](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301200_301299/301234/02.01.01_60/en_301234v020101p.pdf)]. In this mode one directory is available but this directory contains several MOT objects in so called carrousel. These objects ("files") have their own transport ID and content name. Directory typically contains several station logos and binary encoded XML files [[TS 102 371](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102300_102399/102371/03.03.01_60/ts_102371v030301p.pdf)]]. When SPI data is stored, application stores all data from carrousel and additionally also decoded XML file for each binary encoded file.
* MOT directory ID is one of the objects transmitted in SPI application so it has its own transport ID that is called `{directoryID}` in the template.
* SPI application can process data from multiple sources at the same time. These sources are packet data service components within the ensemble each having unique service component ID and XPAD data of selected audio service. Application assigns "virtual" service component ID 65535 to XPAD data. User should take parallel processing into considerations when defining path template - for example service component ID `{scId}` shall be unique but directory ID `{directoryId}` is generally not unique within ensemble.
* SPI data retrieved using RadioDNS feature are not stored.

Default template for SLS application is `SLS/{serviceId}/{contentNameWithExt}`. Using examples from the table, it would store this file under macOS and Linux: `$HOME/Downloads/AbracaDABra/SLS/e01234/stationLogo.jpeg`

Default template for SPI application is `SPI/{ensId}/{scId}_{directoryId}/{contentName}`. Using examples from the table, it would store this file under macOS and Linux: `$HOME/Downloads/AbracaDABra/SPI/e0eeee/47_654321/stationLogo`

## Audio recording
AbracaDABra features audio recording. Two options are available:
* Encoded DAB/DAB+ stream in MP2 or AAC format respectively
* Decoded audio in WAV format

Audio recording can be started and stopped from application menu. It can be also stopped from status bar. The recording files are stored automatically in predefined folder. 

<img width="1326" alt="Snímek obrazovky 2023-12-03 v 16 56 59" src="https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/assets/6438380/92bddcfe-614d-45ea-bb8d-10ede37b61cb">

_Note:_  Audio recording stops when ensemble reconfigures or when any tuning operation is performed. 

## Expert settings
Some settings can only be changed by editing of the INI file. File location is OS dependent:
* macOS: `$HOME/.config/AbracaDABra/AbracaDABra.ini`
* Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\AbracaDABra\AbracaDABra.ini`
* Linux: `$HOME/.config/AbracaDABra/AbracaDABra.ini`

Following settings can be changed by editing AbracaDABra.ini:

      [General]
      audioFramework=0             # 0 means PortAudio (default if available), 1 means Qt audio framework
      keepServiceListOnScan=false  # delete (false, default value) or keep (true) current service list when running band scan 
                                   # note: favorites are not deleted
      
Application shall not run while changing INI file, otherwise the settings will be overwritten.

It is also possible to use other than default INI file using `--ini` or `-i` command line parameter.

## How to install

### macOS
Download latest DMG file from [release page](https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/releases/latest) and install it like any other application. 

There are two versions of DMG, one for Intel Mac and the other from Apple Silicon Mac. Although Intel Mac application runs on both platforms, it is highly recommended to install Apple Silicon version if you have Apple Silicon Mac. Intel build requires at least MacOS Mojave (10.14) and Apple Silicon build needs at least MacOS BigSur (11).

<img width="752" alt="Snímek obrazovky 2023-12-03 v 19 03 37" src="https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/assets/6438380/395a0384-ae2d-48e9-aca1-56169d631a4d">

_Note:_ It seems that Apple did some changes in Sonoma and as a result Intel binaries do not run under macOS Catalina or older. Last binary that is known to run is version 2.2.4. Nevertheless the application code is still compatible with Qt6.4 thus it is possible to build AbracaDABra from source code on device running old macOS version.

### Windows
Download latest Windows zip file from [release page](https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/releases/latest) and unpack it to any folder on your drive. 

RTL-SDR devices need WinUSB driver for correct functionality under Windows. To install it, use Zadig that can be downloaded from [zadig.akeo.ie](https://zadig.akeo.ie). Please follow installation steps described [here](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/getting-the-rtl-sdr-to-work-on-windows-10/). When the driver is installed, start `AbracaDABra.exe` and first band scan should start automatically when RTL-SDR device is recognized. 

Please note that other applications requiring Realtek driver will not work with WinUSB driver from Zadig. 

### Linux
The simplest way is to download latest AppImage file from [release page](https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/releases/latest), 
make it executable and run it. 

There are two versions of AppImage - one for Intel/AMD 64 bit CPU (x86_64) the other for ARM64 CPU (aarch64) so make sure you are downloading the one matching your hardware.

ArchLinux users can install AbracaDABra from <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/abracadabra">AUR</a>.

## How to build
Following libraries are required:
* Qt6
* libusb
* rtldsdr
* faad2 (default) or fdk-aac (optional)
* mpg123
* portaudio (optional but recommended)
* airspy (optional)
* SoapySDR (optional)

For a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 installation you can use the following commands:

       sudo apt-get install git cmake build-essential mesa-common-dev
       sudo apt-get install libusb-dev librtlsdr-dev libfaad2 mpg123 libmpg123-dev libfaad-dev
       sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev qt6-base-dev qt6-multimedia-dev libqt6svg6-dev rtl-sdr   
       sudo apt-get install qt6-tools-dev qt6-tools-dev-tools qt6-l10n-tools
       
Optional Airspy support:       

       sudo apt-get install libairspy-dev

Optional SoapySDR support:       

       sudo apt-get install libsoapysdr-dev

Then clone the project:

       git clone https://github.com/KejPi/AbracaDABra/
       cd AbracaDABra

1. Create build directory inside working copy and change to it

       mkdir build
       cd build

2. Run cmake

       cmake ..
       
    Optional Airspy support:          
       
       cmake .. -DAIRSPY=ON

    Optional SoapySDR support:          
       
       cmake .. -DSOAPYSDR=ON

3. Run make

       make             

4. Install application for all users (optional)

       sudo make install
       sudo ldconfig


_Note:_ `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is `/usr/local` by default. It means that application installs to `/usr/local/bin` and library is installed to `/usr/local/lib`. Make sure that `/usr/local/lib` is in your `ldconfig` path, if it is not then use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable when running AbracaDABra:

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/bin/AbracaDABra &

## USBFS buffer size

USBFS buffer size limitation is typical problem under Linux. In such case RTL-SDR disconnects just after tuning. You may also see a message like this in terminal:

```
Failed to submit transfer 10
Please increase your allowed usbfs buffer size with the following command:
echo 0 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb
```

You can set unlimited size using this command:
```
sudo bash -c 'echo 0 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb'
```
There are instructions on the internet how to make this settings persistent, for example [here](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2/issues/807)
